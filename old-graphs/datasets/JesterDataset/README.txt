Ratings are real values ranging from -10.00 to +10.00 (the value "99" corresponds to "null" = "not rated").
One row per user
The first column gives the number of jokes rated by that user. The next 100 columns give the ratings for jokes 01 - 100.
The sub-matrix including only columns {5, 7, 8, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20} is dense. Almost all users have rated those jokes (see discussion of "universal queries" in the above paper).
